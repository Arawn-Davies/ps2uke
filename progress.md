# Progress log

## 2026-06-12 (cont.) — Stage 4: gsKit framebuffer present path (`d5dce24`)

`ps2_driver.c` now brings up gsKit and presents the engine's 8-bit framebuffer:
`ps2_video_init()` (dmaKit + `gsKit_init_global`/`init_screen`, NTSC, double-
buffered, Z off) sets up a `GS_PSM_T8` texture backed directly by the engine's
`screen` buffer with a `GS_PSM_CT32` CLUT; `_nextpage()` uploads screen+CLUT to
VRAM, blits fullscreen-scaled (GS does the indexed→RGB expansion), vsync-flips;
`VBE_setPalette()` scales BUILD's 0..63 channels to 0..255 and applies the GS
CSM1 CLUT index swizzle (bits 3/4 swapped).

`ps2_main.c` is a **data-free** framebuffer test — fills `screen` with colour
bars + a brightness gradient and presents every frame. **Builds clean, links
into a valid ELF32 MIPS executable.**

**Verification status:** compiles + links only. Visual confirmation needs running
`ps2/ps2uke.elf` on **PCSX2** or hardware (not auto-launched here). Expected: 16
vertical colour bars over a 16-step vertical brightness gradient. If the bars are
miscoloured, the CLUT swizzle/`VBE_setPalette` scaling is the first suspect; if
nothing shows, check the gsKit mode (NTSC vs PAL) and the T8 texture upload.

To run: `./build.sh` (from repo root) → load `ps2/ps2uke.elf` in PCSX2.

### Next: real palette/art (needs Duke data)
Supply `DUKE3D.GRP` (shareware ~11 MB is fine) or the loose `PALETTE.DAT` +
`TILES000.ART`. Then swap the synthetic palette/pattern for `initengine()` +
`loadpalette()` + a real ART tile, and we get actual Duke pixels on screen.

## 2026-06-12 (cont.) — BUILD engine compiles + links for PS2 (stages 1–3)

Verified against the real ps2dev toolchain (gcc 15.2.0) in Docker.

- **Stage 1 — compat layer** (`678b11a`): `PLATFORM_PS2` branch in `platform.h`
  + `ps2_compat.h` (DOSism shims, little-endian, `Uint8/16/32`, timer 120Hz, no
  SDL).
- **Stage 2/3 — build + driver** (`f51c3ca`): `source/buildengine/ps2_driver.c`
  (PS2 platform layer: owns the 8-bit `screen` framebuffer + globals, implements
  `setvmode`/`_setgamemode`/`VBE_setPalette`/`_nextpage`/`drawpixel`/`drawline16`/
  mouse/timer/`filelength`/`stricmp`), `ps2/Makefile` (ps2dev `Makefile.eeglobal`),
  and `ps2/ps2_main.c` smoke-test.

**Milestone reached:** `engine.c + a.c + pragmas.c + cache1d.c + ps2_driver.c`
compile clean and **link into a valid ELF32 MIPS executable** (`ps2uke.elf`,
~2.2 MB). `engine.c` compiled `-DPLATFORM_PS2` with zero changes — the portability
work was all in the compat header + driver. Presentation/palette/pad in the
driver are correct-but-stubbed (no gsKit yet), so the ELF links and boots through
init but doesn't display — that's stage 4.

How to reproduce: `./build.sh` from repo root (or `make` in `ps2/` inside the
image). CI (`ps2.yml`) now builds `ps2/` for real.

### Next: stage 4 — first light
- Flesh out `ps2_driver.c` with gsKit: allocate a GS framebuffer + CLUT, and make
  `_nextpage()` palette-expand `screen` → GS texture and vsync-flip; upload the
  palette in `VBE_setPalette`. Needs `-lgraph -ldraw -ldma -lpacket` etc. in
  `EE_LIBS`. First visible target = palette/title screen with real ART data.
- Then PS2 pad → BUILD input (`readmousexy`/key events), GRP filesystem in
  `cache1d`, and begin wiring the Duke game objects (`source/*.c`, stage 5+).

## 2026-06-12 — Foundation laid

### Where the repo stands
- GitHub: <https://github.com/Arawn-Davies/ps2uke> (branch `main`).
- Working tree is **consistent and non-broken**: no half-written code. CI stays
  green because `ps2.yml` only builds `ps2/` when a `ps2/Makefile` exists and
  otherwise just verifies the ps2dev cross-toolchain (none exists yet — stage 2).

### What's in place
- **PS2 toolchain scaffolding** — `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `build.sh`
  (ps2dev image + make/bash), `.github/workflows/ps2.yml`, `.gitignore`
  (build output + never-commit game data).
- **Source tree is now complete** — `source/` is the icculus Duke3D *game logic*;
  it was missing the renderer. Vendored the portable BUILD engine into
  `source/buildengine/` from [`icculus/buildengine`](https://github.com/icculus/buildengine),
  so `duke3d.h`'s `#include "buildengine/{pragmas,build,engine,engine_protos}.h"`
  now resolve. 39 engine files added.
- **Docs** — `PORTING.md` (architecture, provenance, platform seam, staged
  roadmap) and this log.

### Key findings (so the next session doesn't re-derive them)
- `icculus/duke3d` ships game logic only; the BUILD engine was a separate release.
- `kenbuild.zip` = pure DOS/x86 (asm pragmas, VGA). `buildc.zip` = Ken's C port of
  `A.ASM` but `engine.c` still DOS. Both rejected as the base in favor of
  `icculus/buildengine`, which is already portable C and **32-bit `long`/pointer**
  clean — matching the PS2 EE n32 ABI that BUILD assumes.
- Platform seam = a driver (`sdl_driver.c` / `dos_drvr.c`, chosen in `platform.h`)
  that owns the 8-bit `screen` framebuffer and exposes `setvmode()`,
  `VBE_setPalette()`, `_nextpage()` (present), `getticks()`. PS2 = one more driver.

### Commits today
- `29d9aad` Initial commit: Duke3D source + PS2 toolchain scaffolding
- `761b1fc` Vendor portable BUILD engine + PS2 porting roadmap

### Next session starts here (stage 1–3 in PORTING.md)
1. Add `PLATFORM_PS2` to `source/buildengine/platform.h` + a `ps2_compat.h`
   (little-endian, `__inline`, 32-bit types).
2. Write `ps2/Makefile` for the ps2dev toolchain: compile `source/` +
   `source/buildengine/` + `source/audiolib/` using the **generic** portable
   `pragmas.c` (NOT the x86 `pragmas_gnu.c` / `a_gnu.c`). Iterate to *compile*,
   then to *link* against a stub `ps2_driver.c`.
3. Flesh out `ps2_driver.c` (gsKit framebuffer + CLUT, `_nextpage()` flip).
   First light = palette/title screen.

### Not done (intentionally — large stages, not one-session work)
- No `ps2/Makefile`, no `ps2_driver.c`/`ps2_compat.h` yet → nothing compiles for
  PS2 yet. Audiolib port, GRP filesystem, and input are stages 4–6.
- `DUKE3D.GRP` and other game data remain user-supplied; never committed.
